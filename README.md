# Github Merge Strategies

Tired of reading articles explaining github merge strategies? Want to see examples instead? Then this is the repo for you!

This will include the 3 merge strategies you usually see at the end of a pull request on Github:

1. Merge commit
   * Commit history
   ![commit history](merge-commit/commit-history.png?raw=true)
2. Squash and merge
   * Commit history
   ![commit history](squash-and-merge/commit-history.png?raw=true)
3. Rebase and merge
   * Commit history
   ![commit history](rebase-and-merge/commit-history.png?raw=true)
